Gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and
apply these findings to a selected Bellabeat product to inform marketing
strategy.

## Data Cleaning Process

***277 Rows of missing data labeled (N/A) in columns 'TIME', 'DATE',
'Total_sleep_records', 'Total_minutes_asleep', and 'Time_In_Bed'. Data
cleaning was applied to Activity_data_df for a final DataFrame
Activity_data_dfv3. We started with 12,668 rows and ended with 500
rows.***

Data cleaning was done with R and excel. First half with R, then
imported into excel for additional cleaning.

**R**

-   Merged tables 'sleepDay' & 'dailyActivity' into Activity_data_df.

-   Separated column sleepDay into two different columns & renamed 2 new
    separate columns Date and Time

-   Renamed columns: Origional column names (, TotalSleepRecords,
    TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalSteps, TotalDistance, TrackerDistance,
    LoggedActivitiesDistance, VeryActiveDistance,
    ModeratelyActiveDistance, LightActiveDistance,
    SedentaryActiveDistance, VeryActiveDistance, FairlyActiveDistance,
    lightActiveDistance, SedentaryMinutes). Final column names:
    (Total_Sleep_Records, Total_Minutes_Asleep, Total_Steps,
    Total_Distance, Tracker_Distance, Logged_Activities_Distance,
    Very_Active_Distance, Moderately_Active_Distance,
    Light_Active_Distance, Sedentary_Active_Distance,
    Very_Active_Distance, Fairly_Active_Distance, light_Active_Distance,
    Sedentary_Minutes)

    ![Final Column Names](Bella%20Beats%20Case%20Study%20/Capture.PNG)

    ![](Bella%20Beats%20Case%20Study%20/Capture1.PNG)

-   Created new data frame Activity_data_dfv2. Activity_data_df is
    original data

**Excel:**

-- Transformed Data when imported--

-   Removed column 'Date' \* duplicated 'Activity_Date' column

-   Transformed new duplicated 'Activity_Date' data in column into name
    of day. Ex, 4/12/2016 = Tuesday

-   Renamed new duplicated 'Activity_Date' column to 'Day_of_Week'

-   Removed duplicated values within Total_Distance Column \* Removed
    missing data with n/a values in columns 'TIME', 'DATE',
    'Total_sleep_records', 'Total_minutes_asleep', and 'Time_In_Bed'

## Analysis

#### What is your final conclusion based on your analysis?

**(Please use visualizations. link provided below)**
<https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nolan.saraceni>

My conclusion based on my analysis is overall this is a very well
thought out product and application that is tied to each device. We were
able to find trends that could potentially help with new ideas for
Bellabeat to increase user interaction with the app or with other users.
We decided to use this data and target the IVY which is a elegant and
stylish wrist band. This also seems to be their most promising product
out of the collection. Based on our analysis here are some Key metrics
and elements.

-   Tuesday, Wednesdays, and Saturdays have the highest volume when it
    comes to total calories burned, miles, sleep minutes, and steps.
    Ranked in order of top 3 days of the week, 1.Tuesday, 2.Wednesday,
    3.Saturday.

-   Saturday, Monday, and Friday have the lowest volume when it come to
    the same metrics. Those are total calories burned, miles, sleep
    minutes, and steps. Ranked in order of top worst, 1.Sunday,
    2.Monday, 3.Friday.

-   We compared variables such as sleep vs activity, steps vs calories,
    sleep vs miles.

    -   Steps vs calories: There is a high correlation with steps and
        calories. The higher the steps the more calories burned and vice
        verse.

        ![](calories%20vs%20steps.png){width="342"}

    -   Sleep vs activity: There are correlations between sleep and
        activity. High sleep = high activity. But there were some
        outliers within this data as well. For example, on April 19,
        2016 we record a decent drop in minutes asleep but still had a
        high consistency of activity. Another example, on May 1st-5th we
        have big dip in activity when those days are recorded as the top
        activity days.

        ![Sleep vs
        Activity](Very%20active%20min%20vs%20min%20asleep.png){width="356"}

    -   Sleep vs Miles: These two variable seemed to be tightly
        correlated high sleep = higher miles. May 1st, 2nd and 4th is
        recorded as the lowest volume with total miles but sustained
        relatively high minutes of sleep. This could be a common 'rest'
        day for the user.

![](sleep%20vs%20distance%20miles.png){width="369"}

-   There were IDs attached to each piece of data so we aggregated data
    to each user ID. The IDs can potentially coincide with potential
    'users' as each ID. This allowed us to see some patterns in regards
    to calories burned, sleep, and avg minutes of sleep compared to very
    high activity.

-   Consistency with certain user IDs holding placement either in the
    top or the bottom for both months (April and May). We might be able
    to assume that those IDs are just non-active to low-active users.
    This could be something that could be categorized with the data. Put
    each ID/user into 3 buckets would be helpful. 1.Low, 2.Average,
    3.High- Activity. There are some blank cells within the table and
    this signifies no data collected for reasons that are unknown.
    Reasons could be the item was faulty and didn't pick up the data,
    the user could not have worn the item so no data was tracked, Items
    could have been lost or stolen. Too many unknown factors to pin down
    specific reasoning. There seems to be little correlation between
    calories burned and minutes asleep.

-   Calories burned and Sleep Patterns: This was split up into two
    months worth of data April and May.

    -   **April** Calorie burn: user IDs with the last 3 digits 200,
        328, 313, 081 were the top calorie burners. user IDs with the
        last 3 digits 660, 955, 067, and 665 were the lowest performers
        for the month of April.

    -   **April** Sleep Patters: User IDs 072, 577, 035, and 328 has the
        most overall sleep throughout the week Monday - Sunday as a
        month total. User IDs 002, 171, 955, and 924 has the least
        volume when it came to sleep throughout the week for the month
        of April.

    -   **May** Calorie Burners: Top calorie burners for May ar user IDs
        336, 081, 072, and 279. Lowest calories burners are 665, 200,
        328, and 926.

    -   **May** Sleep Patterns: Top performers were IDs 847, 577, 035,
        and 328. Lowest volume in minutes of sleep for the month of May
        are user IDs 171, 955, 002, and 924.

**There seems to be little correlation between calories burned and
minutes asleep for months April and May.**

#### How could your team and business apply your insights?

We can apply these insights by applying more motivation when it comes to
activity and rest days. More interactions with the app and other users
through the app could be more benefical as well. Users should be
categorized by activity levels but not limited to the amount of features
they can interact with. Users should be categorized into 3 activity
buckets Moderate, Average, High or some sort of variation that separates
and clearly distinguishes the activity level. Take into consideration
the high correlations of data. You can formulate new features within the
app based on these correlations. Take the patterns like sleep patterns
and calories into more forethought. This product fixates on overall
wellness so important key actions should be 'pushed' more than others
such as sleep.

#### Is there additional data you could use to expand on your findings?

More data is always better. Instead of two months of data 6- 8 months
could give us a clear picture and better visualizations in regards to
the volatility of the trends for each user.

## Recommendations

#### What next steps would you or your stakeholders take based on your findings?

-   You want this app to create a sense of community for women.
-   Separate the users in regards to activity and where do they stand.
    This will allow analysis to segregate the users and compare and
    contrast all their data points more effectively. this could allow us
    to see which group has higher overall wellness score.
-   Allow users to interact with each other. The app does a great job
    providing information to users but seems to limit interaction with
    other users. You could add videos that show actual users making the
    recipes Bellabeats suggests but adding their own variations to the
    recipe. You could add live group yoga or pilates sessions and users
    can interact with with comments, messaging, or audio.
-   Add a feature to where users can submit anonymous tips about certain
    subject matters that are more personal. Examples could be talking
    about sex, pregnancy, and menstrual cycles and even relationship
    issues.
-   The app could also incorporate bi-annual group outdoor activities
    across the country for Bellabeat near by users.
-   Postpartum could be taken a bit further. Have a feature where there
    is a group for postpartum moms that allows them to interact with one
    another. Everyone has their own little secrets when dealing with
    specific situations come postpartum. Let that be shared.
-   Allow users to keep track of their calorie intake.

#### How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

-   Create a outdoor activity day for current users within a high
    Bellabeat user area. So if a city has a high user activity formulate
    a Bellabeat outdoor activity day in that area. This could allow
    users to bring friends and family. This can bring new potential
    customers. Have additional attendees sign up with simple contact
    information via QR code.
-   Product giveaway/prize giveaways for consistent high activity. Much
    like a fitness of the year award.
-   User appreciation every month. Have people submit their personal
    stories to be chosen for Bellabeat user appreciation month. The
    user, when chosen, gets the ability to pop on a podcast with one of
    the hosts associated with Bellbats and have conversation.
-   Have incentives that push better wellness. A wellness campaign that
    specifically targets all aspects of the users wellness.
-   Celebrate users who have had children
-   Bring Bellabeat users on a Bellabeat podcast that allows them to
    talk about their experience and share who they are. Call it inside
    with Bella. But the catch is every user is a Bella.
