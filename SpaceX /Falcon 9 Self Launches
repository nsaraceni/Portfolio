SpaceX’s accomplishments include: Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station. 
Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing satellite Internet access. Sending manned missions to Space. 
One reason SpaceX can do this is the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Spaces X’s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets.
